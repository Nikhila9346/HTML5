        <dd>Hey! Hii Welcome to Movie World. The <b>Cinema of India</b>, consisting of motion pictures made by the Indian film industry, has had a large effect on world cinema since the second half of the 20th century. Indian cinema is made up of various film industries, including Hindi cinema, which makes motion pictures in the Hindi language and is one of the biggest film industries in the country. In 2021, Telugu cinema became the largest film industry in India in terms of box office receipts. Major centers of film production across the country include <i>Mumbai, Chennai, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Kochi, Bangalore, Bhubaneswar-Cuttack, and Guwahati.</i> For a number of years, the <u>Indian film industry has ranked first in the world</u> in terms of annual film output. In 2022, Indian cinema earned â‚¹15,000 crore ($1.7955 billion) at the box-office.<br>
        Indian cinema is a global enterprise, and its films have attracted international attention and acclaim throughout South Asia. Since the inception of Indian cinema in 1913, Hindi cinema enjoyed the position of top film industry, but in recent years it has faced stiff competition from its compatriots. Overseas Indians account for 12% of the industry's revenue.
